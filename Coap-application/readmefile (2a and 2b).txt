I have downloaded the coap example of node js and tried to run the program from this file itself.
Readme file for 2a and 2b
the client.js and server.js files are in the temperature folder 
The client.js file has the code for 2a.
The server.js file has the code for 2b.

Steps to run the file
1)Go to temperature folder in the nodeJs command prompt and run the server.js file using node server.js command
2)Then run the code for client code with "node client.js" command.

The temperature gets displayed on the server side.
